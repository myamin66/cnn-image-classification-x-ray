# Image Classification with CNN
Please download Chest-X-Ray Images Dataset from Kaggle, 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
Dataset Information: 
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.
Task:
•	Define a CNN with four Convolution Layers (16, 32, 64, 128) with kernal size 3.  (10 points)
•	Apply appropriate activation function at the last layer (10 points)
•	compile the model (5 points)
•	train it on 50 epochs using 300 images from each of the two classes (total 600), report training and validation accuracy (5 points)
•	plot accuracy graph for training and validation (5 points)
•	if model overfits, retrain on the revised number of epochs to overcome overfitting (10 points)
•	evaluate model on the test dataset and report test accuracy (5 points)
